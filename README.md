 🛒 Shopping Cart - React & TailwindCSS

📌 Project Overview

This is a React Shopping Cart project designed to enhance my skills in state management, React hooks, and best practices. It allows users to add, remove, and manage items in their cart while persisting cart data using localStorage. The UI is styled using TailwindCSS for a modern, responsive design.

✨ Features

✅ Add to Cart - Users can add items to their shopping cart.

✅ Remove from Cart - Users can remove individual items.

✅ Quantity Management - Increase or decrease item quantity.

✅ Total Price Calculation - Displays the total cost of all items.

✅ Cart Persistence - Cart data is saved in localStorage.

✅ Responsive Design - Fully optimized for desktop and mobile.
